I'm a research assistant at [Sharif Policy Research Institute](https://spri.sharif.ir/en/)(SPRI). I have a MSc. in energy economics at [Shahid Beheshti University](https://en.sbu.ac.ir/). Previously, I was an undergrad in mathematics and applications at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/). I'm passionate about learning the multi-objective optimization, optimal control theory, machine learning, energy economics, composite indicators, and monetary economics.

Here's my [CV](https://alifaryadras.github.io/_pages/cv.pdf).
