I'm a research assistant at the Sharif Policy Research Institute ([SPRI](https://spri.sharif.ir/en/)) and a master's student of energy economics at [Shahid Beheshti University](https://en.sbu.ac.ir/). Previously, I was an undergrad in mathematics and applications at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/). I'm passionate about learning the multi-objective optimization, machine learning, energy economics, and monetary economics.
